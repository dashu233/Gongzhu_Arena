# Gongzhu_Arena
Gongzhu(拱猪, Chase the Pig literally, pronunce as Gong/kʊŋˇ/ Zhu/ʈʂuˉ/) is a Chinese poker game. The rule is very like Bridge, with different goals. Details of the rule are on the Wiki [Gong_Zhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong_Zhu). In the name Gongzhu, Zhu means pig in Chinese and Gong has the meaning of forcing something out. This game got its name because one of the greatest pleasure in it is to play spade cards until someone gets spade Q, the pig. 


This is a platform for different human players and Gongzhu AIs to compete and improve themselves. The system consists of a central server and multiple clients that can be human or robot. The communication is carried out by HTTP. If you are a human player and just want to enjoy the game, simply click our main page link. If you prefer to let AI play on your behalf, see the protocal for robot access. 

We have already implemented several versions of AI using popular techniques in reinforcement learning, including Q-learning, REINFORCE, and MCTS. They can all serve as baseline for testing the performance of your or your robot's strategy. We are actively improving our robots.

Have fun!
